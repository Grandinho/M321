## Node processes

- each Node has multiple Pods on it
- 3 processes must be installed on every Node
- Worker Nodes do the actual work

### Container-Runtime
For example Docker
### Kubelet
- Kubelet interacts with both - the container and node
- Kubelet starts the pod with a container inside

### Kube-Proxy
- Kube-Proxy forwards the requests


### Interaction
How does the interaction with the cluster works.
- schedule pod
- monitor
- re-schedule/re-start pod
- join a new Node

#### Master Nodes
- 4 processes run on every master node
- there are usually few master nodes

##### Api Server
- cluster gateway for communication, like Client or Kubectl
- acts as a gatekeeper for authentication
- some request -> api server -> validates request -> other processes 

##### Scheduler
- allows to schedule a new pod
- has a logic decide where to put the Pod

##### Controller manager
- detects cluster state changes

##### etcd
- Key value Store of the cluster state
- Cluster changes get stored in etcd
- Application data is not stored in etcd
